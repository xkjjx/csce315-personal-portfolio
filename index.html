                    I am a Computer Engineering major at Texas A&M University with plenty of experience in a wide variety of fields. My electrical engineering skills include designing amplification circuits using field effect and bipolar transistors, analyzing analog systems, designing basic radio systems, analyzing transmission lines, and much more. In addition, I am highly proficient in C++ and it's use object in object oriented programming. I am also well versed in Python as it's use as a calculating tool for engineers in order to automate repetitive and tedious tasks, as well as its ability to create useful and fun projects relatively quickly due to its extensive packages and libraries.
