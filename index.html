                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Computer Engineering major at Texas A&M University excited to use my widespread knowledge to make an impact on the world. In addition to my technical skills that I have gathered through this degree, I am proficient in leading a team and communicating with others to accomplish my goals. I am also a very quick learner and am able to adapt to new situations quickly, which is essential for success in the rapidly changing tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am well-versed in many principles of Computer Science that has allowed me to gain a fundamental understanding of how computers work. As someone who's always been fascinated by this complex machine that we take for granted, I've loved learning every bit about the complex systems people have built to make our modern world possible. More recently in college, I've started to work with others on huge projects with massive impact. Through this, I've realized that my work as a leader can be much more profound than my work as an individual - thus while I value my ability to be technically strong, I'm working harder to become a better leader and communicator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Texas A&M University, I am involved in MSC Hospitality and Student Engineers' Council. Please see my service page for further details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I love running - in my time at high school cross country, I have built up to 60 miles per week at certain points and I believe this played a crucial role in making me who I am today. I still run ocassionally, so feel free to check my running page!
