                <h2>
                    Qualifications
                </h2>
                <h3>Technical Qualifications:</h3>
                <p>- Programming Languages: C++, Python, Bash, Java</p>
                <p>- Technologies/Libraries: Linux, Node.js, TensorFlow, NumPy, AWS, Git, Verilog, Cadence, Verilog</p>
                <p>- Expertise: Data Structures, Algorithms, Digital System Design, API Development, Computer Architecture</p>
                <p> I have a lot of experience using C++ for solving problems - my most fundamental Computer Science classes were taught in C++, and I've developed a strong understanding of it's usefulness and it's unique features that sets it apart from C. While I have not used C as much, I still have a good understanding of it and how it compiles down to Assembly and further about how these assembly instructions can be processed by the computer.</p>
                <p> I have also used Python for a variety of tasks, including web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning. I have used it to develop a Twitter bot that tweets out the weather, and I have used it to learn about building basic regression models using Sci-Kit Learn as well as advanced neural networks using TensorFlow.</p>
                <p>Throughout all of my classes, I have become proficient in both the Linux environment as well as bash. As a Mac user, I am also familiar with using similar commands in all of my creative/programming works.</p>
                <p>I am also well-versed in JavaScript, both for its use in frontend use case as well as its backend use case as Node.js.</p>
                <p>In addition to designing the website, I also have experience in hosting it in cloud services, both using general purpose technologies such as AWS EC2 as well as specialized technologies that make the hosting process extremely simple for the customer.</p>
                <p>I also have a multitude of experience in Verilog, which I have used to design a computer that can decode basic ArmV8 instructions. I have also synthesized Verilog code for use in a FPGA and converted Verilog code to a Digital IC Design using Cadence Innovus.</p>
                <h3>Accomplishments:</h3>
                <p>- Led encryption application project at <a href="https://www.nsin.mil/x-force/">NSIN X-Force</a> using C++ and Python on Raspberry Pi</p>
                <p>- Completed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses" target="_blank">Stanford and Deeplearning.ai Machine Learning Courses</a>, applying principles with TensorFlow</p>               
                <p>- Executed Data Analysis project using Python libraries for language population conclusions</p>
                <p>- Developed Twitter/Instagram Weather Bot for automated weather updates</p>

                <h3>Non-Technical Accomplishments (Please see my <a href="service.html">service page</a> for more information):</h3>
                <p>- MSC Hospitality member involved in Tours, Internal Relations, and Marketing Committee</p>
                <p>- Career Fair Marketing Coordinator for SEC, successfully marketing the largest student-led career fair</p>
                <p>- Effective communication of project accomplishments during NSIN X-Force internship</p>
                <p>- Trained tour guide for local campus attractions with MSC Hospitality</p>
